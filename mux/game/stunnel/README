stunnel.conf.example       -- The example stunnel.conf file.  If you wish to
                              create this manually you're welcome to.  Just
                              make sure the end file is stunnel.conf
stunnel_setup              -- the script to build a stunnel.conf file for you
                              which will be dropped at your specified location.
stunnel_kill               -- Stop/terminate the stunnel process.
stunnel_start              -- Start the stunnel process.
warpbubble                 -- the perl script that handles stunnel to mush 
                              connectivity.
stunnel_src                -- If you do not have stunnel, this directory will
                              allow you to download, compile and locally install.

You need to set up your netrhost.conf file with the appropriate changes
to enable stunnel/SSL proxy connectivity.  These *MUST BE ADDED* to your
netrhost.conf file prior to launching RhostMUSH.

sconnect_reip 1            -- This enables the SSL tunnel layer handler
                              within rhost.
sconnect_cmd XYZZY         -- this will set the secret SSL command
                              handshake command to XYZZY.  This is case
                              sensitive and can be up to 31 characters.
                              Please make sure to only use printable 
                              non-whitespace characters.  Ergo: one word
sconnect_host wildcards    -- This allows wildcarded sites (one or more)
                              to allow to access the sconnect/stunnel
                              handler.  This defaults to 'localhost' so
                              if you have 'localhost.localdomain' instead
                              then you must set this to whatever is seen
                              as 'localhost' to you.  You can verify this
                              by checking your /etc/hosts file.

Note: the sconnect_host is optional.  If you do not specify it, it will
      default to two values:  'localhost' and '127.0.0.1'.
  
Be aware that if you have DNS host lookups disabled on your mush, you
MUST have 127.0.0.1 as an entry for your sconnect_host file.

When you have your stunnel.conf file to the way you want, you then
issue the following command to run your SSL layer.

                ./stunnel_start

Please be aware that the port that the SSL layer is on must be opened
in any firewall rule you specified to allow the connectivity.

Happy SSLing.
